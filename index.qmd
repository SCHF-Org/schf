At the Salerno Center for Human Flourishing, we examine the profound, intimate connection between art and ethics. Exploring art's capacity to ignite ethical reflection on our deepest bonds—family, friendship, love—and the meaningful paths toward union with God. We look at how powerful artworks—such as those which may reimagine Shakespeare's tragic heroine through themes of loss, resilience, and redemptive love, dystopian video games with their gripping moral choices—have the potential to spark our moral imagination. These creations intend to prompt us to reflect deeply on our core ethical commitments: bonds of family and friendship, romantic love, personal meaning, and life's greater purpose.

Join us as we bridge philosophy, technology, and creativity to nurture a more deeper connection with God and with each other.

If you are a someone working at the intersection of music, games and other aspects of popculture and ethics, or a professional game designer working on a game that focuses on ethical play, you are welcome to contribute to this site. I am particularly looking for:

* Links to papers (past or present) on games and ethics,
* Reviews of games with interesting approaches to ethical play,
* Reviews of books on games and ethics,
* Announcements of events (conferences, workshops etc) related to games and ethics.
