At the Salerno Center for Human Flourishing, we examine the profound, intimate connection between art and ethics. We explore how powerful works—like Taylor Swift's "The Fate of Ophelia," which reimagines Shakespeare's tragic heroine through themes of loss, resilience, and redemptive love, and the BioShock series by 2K Games, with its gripping moral choices in dystopian worlds—spark our imagination. These creations prompt us to reflect deeply on our core ethical commitments: bonds of family and friendship, romantic love, personal meaning, and life's greater purpose.
Join us as we bridge philosophy, technology, and creativity to nurture a more ethical, flourishing world.
