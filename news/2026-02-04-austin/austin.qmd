* Lecture 1:
  * Law set by political superiors to inferiors
  * Rules issued by a sovereign

> But, as contradistinguished to *natural* law, or to the *law of nature* (meaning, by those expressions, the law of God), the aggregate of the rules, established by political superiors, is frequently styled positive law, or law existing by *position*.

* But there is a second class of rules, not from sovereign to non-sovereign
* But equal to equal

> But the aggregate of the human laws, which are improperly styled *laws*, is not unfrequently denoted by one of the following expressions: "moral rules," "the moral law," "the law set or prescribed by *general* or *public* opinion."

* Therefore all law (commands) is either properly called a law, or related to a law.
* And backed by the power to enforce sanctions

> A command is distinguished from other significations of desire, not by the style in which the desire is signified, but by the power and the purpose of the party commanding to inflict an evil or pain in case the desire be disregarded. [6]

* But now, because a sovereign has the potential to inflict a harm (sanction) should I disobey their command, I have an duty to obey their command. But is duty the same thing as obligation?
* The greater the threatened sanction, the greater my duty
* Only harm is correlative with duty and obligation, not promise of reward
* Commands are occasioned but rules are general, "obliging to acts of a certain kind".
  * But what about commands by a judge which are occasioned vs. commands by a ruler?
* When does a commandment become a law?
  * A commandment becomes a rule
  * The rule becomes general
    * In its application
    * In its appropriate context
  * The commandment then becomes a law

> Concisely expressed, the meaning of the correlative is this. He who will inflict an evil in case his desire be disregarded, utters a command by expressing or intimating his desire: He who is liable to the evil in case he disregard the desire, is bound or obliged by the command. [8]
