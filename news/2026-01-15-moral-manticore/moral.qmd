The Manticore is an imagined beast that has been found in literature as early as the 5th and 4th century BC. In his Photius, the Greek historian working for the Persian court writes describes the Manticore as a beast with red skin, as large as a lion, three rows of teeth, human like face and the tail of a scorpian. Later writers would quote Ctesias' description of the Manticore, adding emphasis on the dietary habits of it, including that it ate men. Though it is likely that many of these descriptions were of predatory animals passed by word of mouth until they reached the Persian king's court, what is even more important is the way in which these descriptions began to stand in for imageries of evil in the Medieval literature.
