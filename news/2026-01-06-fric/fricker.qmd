There is a distinctive kind of epistemic harm/injustice that consists undermining our ability to convey knowledge to others and make sense of our own experiences [@fric07].

Miranda @fric07 argues that social power is a socially situated capacity to control another's actions [@fric07, 9-13]. The teacher's ability is a social power rooted in the collective imagination of a community. Through her grading of her student's work, a teacher is able to influence whether or not a student uses capital letters at the start of a sentence.

Sometimes this social power is exercised in a way to create prejudicial stereotypes. A prejudicial stereotype is a kind image about what attributes belong to which social groups. The stereotype distort a hearer's ability to apply the apt credibility judgments in a given domain, such as testimony. Some groups are unfairly benefited from the exercise of this power while other groups are unfairly penalized.

A virtuous hearer is one who reliably corrects for the influence of prejudice in her credibility judgments. Perhaps she is able to recognize when her judgments are not apt, and is able to recognize that they are not apt because of the prejudice that she holds. Therefore, virtuous testimonial injustice corrects for the influence of identity prejudice.

Power is a social capacity/agency. It is a kind of agency that fortifies the ability of its host to influence what happens in the world. There are two ways to exercise this agency, human or structural. We can imagine a person who is able to convince a jury that a crime occurred. But the human capacity is dependent on a structure that enables the human to articulate his argument in a way that does not distort it. It depends on an educational history. Therefore human agency is in many ways also structural. So structural agency is merely structural human agency.

Additionally, the kinds of events that we care most about, are those that occur in the social realm and there are two ways to make these kinds of events occur, through active human agency, or passive structural agency. Therefore power, human or structural, is social power and its agents are social agents and the hosts of social power are social agents.

But who are these agents? Those who are agents are those for whom society imagines to be endowed with a special kind of agency. For instance, a police officer is a person whom society imagines to be endowed with a characteristic social power. This power comes from an additional imagination such that that individual who is a police officer, is somehow deserving of this power.

In the social imagination, this person possess enough self-control such that they are allowed to carry firearms, unlike convicted felons. Therefore the central cases of testimonial injustice is prejudicial and consists in credibility excesses and deficits where we give more credibility to some identities and less to others.

Fricker argues in the second chapter that prejudice is made possible through stereotypes [For instance, see @kahn82]. These stereotypes persist through the social imagination, but more importantly, there is a question about their source. A form of agency then involves the ability of an individual or group of individuals to infuse the social imagination with stereotypes.
